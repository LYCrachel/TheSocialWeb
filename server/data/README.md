All the gathered Twitter data can be found in the folder called: Twitter data --- Social web.
This folder contains both the old restricted data as the full data used in the final version of the project in the respectivly folders old and new twitter data.

The old twitter data folder contains the data created with the use of the Python script called OldVersionTwitterScript.py. The folder also contains the set parameters in the run of the code.

The new twitter data folder contains the data about the companies KLM and Deloite. The explanation also in folder contains a link to a folder with all data gathered, which were stored there due to the size limit of Github. 
The new twitter data is gathered by running 2 scripts. Gathering_of_tweets.py and Tweets_of_a_user.py. Gathering_of_tweets.py is for collecting the tweets about a company. The Tweets_of_a_user is used to gather tweets posted by a specific user.
